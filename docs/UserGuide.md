## FAQ ##

Q: How do I load data from another computer?

A: Delete the `addressbook.json` file (stored at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` )
from the computer that you wish to use LinkMeIn on. Then, copy over the `addressbook.json` file
from the computer which you no longer wish to use LinkMeIn on. After which, boot up LinkMeIn
to check whether your doctor information is properly loaded into the new computer.
