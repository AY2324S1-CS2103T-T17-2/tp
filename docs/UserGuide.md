    </div>

9. Great job! You are now ready to learn about the [GUI](#introducing-linkmeins-gui) of LinkMeIn!

[&uarr; Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

# Introducing LinkMeIn's GUI
LinkMeIn's [GUI](#glossary) is designed to be **simple** and **intuitive**, with you in mind.
The GUI consists of four main components:

![uiIntro.png](images/ui-intro/uiIntro.png)

Here are what each components stand for:

| Number | Component            | Description                                              |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Command Box          | Key in your commands here and LinkMeIn will execute them |
| 2      | Message Box          | Displays success or error messages to you                |
| 3      | Company List Panel   | Displays the list of companies that you have added       |
| 4      | Company Detail Panel | Displays the details of the company that you are viewing |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Useful Tip:**<br>
* To maximise your viewing experience, opt for full-screen mode in LinkMeIn!
</div>

Now that you've been introduced to the GUI, let's move on to learning how you can use CLI to interact with LinkMeIn. 

[&uarr; Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

# Introducing LinkMeIn's CLI

LinkMeIn operates through the Command Line Interface (CLI), a method of interacting with a computer program by **entering line of 
text known as command-lines.** Say goodbye to the days of multitasking between typing and clicking, and say hello to the world of CLI!

Don't let the name intimidate you! Continue reading on to discover how **E**ffortless, **E**asy and **E**fficient CLI is when using LinkMeIn.

<div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/cli-description/CliDescription1.png" alt="CliDescription1" width="650"/>
</div>

The Command Box serves as the gateway for entering command lines. Once you press enter, LinkMeIn processes your input and provides responses through the Message Box. This process of interacting with LinkMeIn through text is exactly how CLI works!
Now, let's move on to learn how to write command lines, and you are ready to try LinkMeIn!

## Command Format
A command line has 4 components, **command word**, **index**, **prefix** and **parameter**.

| Component    | Example    | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command word | `add`      | Indicates the feature to be executed                                                                                                                      |
| Index        | `1`, `5`   | Indicates the position of the company in the list (e.g., 5th company in the list)                                                                         |
| Parameter    | `John Doe` | Represents the updated value or content. <br/> These values, which are provided by the user, replaces the `UPPER_CASE` placeholders in the command format |
| Prefix       | `c/`       | Indicates the type of parameter to be edited (e.g., name)                                                                                                 |

_You can find all the parameters used in LinkMeIn [here](#parameters-description)._
_To learn more about the prefixes and command words used in LinkMeIn, you can refer to the [Command Summary Section](#command-summary)._

Now, let's see how you can use these components to easily write a command!
The following color code will assist you in highlighting each component for better understanding. 

<div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/cli-description/CommandFormat1.png" alt="CommandFormat1" width="650"/>
</div>

Let's use the [`add` command](#adding-a-company--add) format as shown below to explain the components. 
<div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
    <img src="images/cli-description/CommandFormat2.png" alt="CommandFormat2" width="650"/>
</div>

The `add` command is used to initiate the adding a company into LinkMeIn. Every command line should begin with a command word to specify the desired feature.
The prefix indicates the parameter type. For example, `c/John` adds "John" as the company name while `n/John` adds "John" as the recruiter's name.
Simply replace the parameters with your specific application details, and you have effectively crafted an `add` command!

But wait! Notice the `[]` around `pr/PRIORITY`? 

| Symbol  | Description      | Example          | Interpretation                                        |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| None    | Compulsory field | `C/COMPANY_NAME` | The company's name is required when adding a company  |
| `[ ]`   | Optional field   | `[pr/PRIORITY]`  | Not a must to indicate priority when adding a company |

Since `PRIORITY` parameter is optional, the following command lines are accepted.

**Example:**
- `add c/GovTech r/Software Engineer s/PA n/John Doe d/12-12-2023 e/johnDoe@gmail.com p/98765432 pr/medium`
- `add c/GovTech r/Software Engineer s/PA n/John Doe d/12-12-2023 e/johnDoe@gmail.com p/98765432`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes:**<br>
* Parameters can be in any order. e.g. if the command specifies c/COMPANY_NAME r/ROLE, r/ROLE c/COMPANY_NAME is also acceptable.
* Parameters are case-insensitive. e.g. c/COMPANY_NAME is the same as c/company_name.
</div>

Notice that the `add` command does not use `INDEX` in its command format. Each feature has a unique command format.
You can find the command format for each feature in the [Features](#current-features) section
or do a [quick tour](#introducing-linkmein-a-quick-tour) to get your hands on LinkMeIn.

### Duplicate Detection

_Seeking an internship but worried about double-applying? 
Our duplicate detection swiftly ensures you never submit the same application twice!_

How does LinkMeIn determine if a company is a duplicate? If you try to **add** a company with the same **company name**,
**role**, and **deadline** as an existing application in LinkMeIn, you will see an error message in the command box information 
you of the duplicate company. 

- LinkMeIn's duplicate check is **case-insensitive** 


**Example:**
Adding a company with the same fields as an existing company

![img.png](images/duplicate-detection/add-command/duplicate-exact-match.png)

**Example:**
Adding a company with the same company name, deadline and role but different recruiter's information or application status

![img.png](images/duplicate-detection/add-command/duplicate-partial-match.png)

LinkMeIn's duplicate check does not stop with adding entries. If you attempt to **edit** an application, creating a 
duplicate entry with the same company, role, and deadline as an existing application in LinkMeIn, 
an error message will be displayed in the command box, notifying you of the duplicate company as seen below.

options to find, list, filter, and sort companies, offering you a comprehensive toolkit to manage and organize your entire company portfolio efficiently.

### Find a company: `find`

_You've applied to many companies, and now you want to track a specific internship application for a particular
company. Use the `find` command to quickly locate the company you want._

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

-   **Case-Insensitive Search:** Whether you type `tiktok` or `TikTok`, it will still match `TikTok`.
-   **Order Independent:** You can search for `tiktok google` and it will find `Google TikTok`.
-   **Substring Matching:** Typing `tik` will return companies like `TikTok`.

> **Note:** The `find` command searches only the company name.

**Search Criteria:**

-   Companies with names that contain **any** of the keywords will be returned. You can enter multiple keywords.

**Example:**

**Step 1:** Let's say you want to follow up on a DSTA application. Simply type `find ds` to search for DSTA.

![img.png](images/find-command/BeforeFind.png)

**Step 2:** You will see the list of companies that match your search criteria. In this case, the company DSTA will be

### Listing all contacts : `list`

_You've found the specific company you wanted using the find command earlier, and now you want to see all of your applications in one list again. You can do so easily with the `list` command!_

**Format:** `list`

**Example:**

**Step 1:** You have used the `find` command to find the company _DSTA_ earlier. Now, you want to see all of your applications in one list again. Simply type `list` to view the full list of your applications again!

![img.png](images/list-command/ListCommand.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>

</div>

[&uarr; Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Filter companies by application status: `filter`

_Can't remember which applications you haven't submitted or want to prepare for the companies that have offered you an interview?
Filter the list of companies by their application status using the `filter` command!_

**Format:** `filter s/APPLICATION_STATUS`

> [**APPLICATION_STATUS**](#application-status-parameter-description) should be one of the following: `PA`, `PI`, `PO`, `A`, `R`.

**Example:**

**Step 1:** You want to prepare for the upcoming interviews you have received. 

**Step 2:** Simply type `filter s/PI` to filter the list of companies to show only companies with status "Pending Interview" and press Enter.

![img.png](images/filter-command/FilterByPI.png)

**Step 3:** You can then view all the companies that you have pending interviews for from the company list.

![img.png](images/filter-command/AfterFilterCommand.png)

**Possible Error:**

If you enter an invalid prefix for the filter command, you will see an error message informing you of the invalid command, and suggest the correct format to follow.

### Sort companies by their deadlines: `sort`

_Want to see which application deadlines are coming up soon or which ones are far off? Use the `sort` command to
arrange your list of applications based on their deadlines._
arrange your list of applications based on their deadlines._

**Format:** `sort SORT_ORDER`

Where `SORT_ORDER` can be:

-   `ascending` or its short forms `a` or `asc`: to sort nearest deadlines first.

-   `descending` or its short forms `d` or `desc`: to sort furthest deadlines first.

-   The sort is case-insensitive. e.g. `ASCENDING` and `ascending` are treated the same.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* If no order is specified, sort will default to `ascending`.
</div>

**Example:**

**Step 1.** You've lost track of time and are uncertain about which internship deadlines are looming. Your current
list looks chaotic. Just type `sort ascending` to sort the list of applications by their deadlines.

![typecommand.png](images/sort-command/BeforeSorting.png)

**Step 2.** Your applications are now organized by upcoming deadlines. Time to start applying without delay!

![img.png](images/sort-command/AfterSorting.png)

**Possible Error**

Suppose you misspelled the `SORT-ORDER` keyword, you will see an error message informing you of the invalid command,
